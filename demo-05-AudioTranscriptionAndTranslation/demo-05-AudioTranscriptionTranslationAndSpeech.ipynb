At Hogwarts, Harry makes friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and learns about the magical world he never knew existed. He also discovers that his parents were murdered by the dark wizard Voldemort, who tried to kill Harry as a baby but mysteriously failed, leaving Harry with a lightning bolt scar. Over seven years at Hogwarts, Harry faces numerous challenges and adventures, from confronting a troll in his first year to competing in the dangerous Triwizard Tournament in his fourth. Each year brings new defense against the dark arts teachers, some helpful and others harboring dark secrets. As Harry grows, he learns more about his connection to Voldemort, including a prophecy that links their fates. Voldemort, meanwhile, slowly regains power and gathers his Death Eater followers. Harry receives guidance from Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, who helps him understand the power of love and sacrifice in magic. In the later books, Harry learns about Horcruxes, objects containing pieces of Voldemort's soul, and embarks on a perilous quest to destroy them. The series culminates in an epic battle at Hogwarts, where Harry must confront his own mortality and make difficult choices to defeat Voldemort once and for all. Throughout the series, themes of friendship, bravery, and the power of choice are explored, as Harry and his friends navigate the complexities of growing up while facing extraordinary circumstances.\n",
